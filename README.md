### What I learned

While I'm glad I can manipulate my code to very closely replicate the designs of these projects in the end, I continue to be disappointed in the efficiency and clarity of my code. For this project in particular, I struggled to align the layout of the mobile design with methods like flexbox, so I resorted to remote positioning of the elements that didn't want to line up, adjusting their position over and over until they looked right. It's good to learn to be comfortable with this kind of trial-and-error experimentation to get a result that looks attractive and functional, but I know it isn't an ideal solution.
